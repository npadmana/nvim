Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## NP Release Notes

### Initial Setup

- markdown
  - Start by setting up markdown here, so that we can keep track of changes, put
    in examples etc.
  - My initial plan here was to not use render-markdown, but it seems to be the best option.
    In which case, I'm just going to use LazyVim's markdown language extra.

**WIP**

- tree-sitter more languages
